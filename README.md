# i3 wm install for ArchLinux

This repo contains fast one-command installation for i3 windows manager customized for work out of box.  
This is not some challenge or proof of concept. Main goal for me in this project was building fast installation script while migrating between different PC/Laptops etc. You install ArchLinux, run script, ready for work.
